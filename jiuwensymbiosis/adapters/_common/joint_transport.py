"""``JointTransport`` — the vendor seam for a joint-level SDK.

Some arms expose a real Cartesian interface in firmware (their driver wraps a
``move_linear(pose)`` and satisfies ``CartesianDriver`` directly). Others only take
joint-motor targets plus an observation stream; the Cartesian layer (FK/IK,
waypoints, arrival polling, safety) has to live above the SDK. ``JointTransport``
is that lower seam: the *only* part an adapter for a joint-level arm must hand-
write. Everything above it is provided once by ``KinematicArmDriver``.

Design mirrors ``VisionMixin.get_grasp_info_simple`` (whose only vendor-specific
step is the ``_project_pixel_to_base_raw`` seam) — the framework owns the
pipeline; the adapter injects the single vendor-specific piece. Structural
typing (``Protocol``) keeps the SDK object free of any framework base class.

Contract:
  * ``open`` / ``close`` are the SDK connection lifecycle; ``close`` is idempotent.
  * ``read_arm_joints`` / ``send_arm_joints`` carry the *arm* joints only, in the
    SDK's native unit, in a fixed order the adapter and its ``KinematicSpec``
    agree on. The end effector (if any) is a separate channel and never enters
    this vector, so FK/IK and joint-limit checks see arm joints alone.
  * ``send_arm_joints`` returns the target the SDK actually accepted (some SDKs
    clamp per-command deltas); arrival is still judged from ``read_arm_joints``.
  * ``read_effector`` / ``send_effector`` are one effector-neutral two-state
    channel — a parallel gripper and a suction cup both ride it (engaged =
    holding), so the same transport serves either grasp capability.

A transport that also carries a camera / hand-eye calibration may additionally
expose ``grab_frames`` / ``intrinsics`` / ``tf_flange_cam`` / ``calibration``;
``KinematicArmDriver`` forwards those (duck-typed) so vision composes when present.
