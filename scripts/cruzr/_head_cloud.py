"""Cruzr-only: head detection mask + head stereo point cloud -> base-frame footprint geometry.

This lets the wide-FOV head camera verify the "target on reference surface" relation in 3-D
during search (reuses the shared ``_on_surface`` predicate).

Pure numpy, offline-testable. The head point cloud
(``/sensor/camera/stereo/pointcloud/jazzy``) is row-major per-pixel, in METERS, in the same optical
frame as the head detection RGB, so a full-res mask maps onto it by uniform downsampling. It is
normally ORGANIZED (H×W×3); when it arrives UNORGANIZED (height=1 → ``(1, N, 3)``) but its point
count matches the RGB resolution we reshape it back to the image grid (see ``rgb_hw`` below) —
otherwise the mask would collapse onto row 0. Holes on untextured surfaces come through as NaN and
are dropped. Coordinates are
converted to millimetres (×1000) before applying ``tf_base_cam`` (whose translation is already in
mm) so the result is the same scale as the waist pixel-reprojected geometry.
